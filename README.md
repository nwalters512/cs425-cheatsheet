# CS 425 Cheatsheet

I compiled this from Indy's CS 425 lecture slides in tha FA18 semester. It
contains as much content from the slides as I could manage to fit on here;
if you were to make the font smaller or mess with line spacing, you could
probably fit even more information!

## Compiling

I wrote and compiled this document on
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com?r=82cf1f20&rm=d&rs=b), which I love for
its simple and foolproof nature. Unfortunately, it makes collaborating on
documents like this a bit tricky, as it requires you to upload all of these
assets individually. However, I still think it's much easier than getting a
full LaTeX installation on your own machine.

## Contributing

Pull requests with enhancements to content, layout, etc. are welcome! If you
use this cheat sheet for your own purposes and end up modifying it, it would
be great if you conld contribute your improvements back to the repo.

## A word of warning

When using cheat sheets, I've often found that their true value is not so much
in having the information available on the exam, but rather that the process
of creating them forces me to review, process, and summarize information. If
your finals preparation strategy is nothing but "print this cheat sheet", you
probably won't succeed. However, this cheat sheet could still be a useful
resource as you prepare for the exam.
